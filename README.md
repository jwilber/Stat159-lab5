# Stat159-lab5


a. User A; Jared Wilber


b. User B; Manuel Horta  

Questions:

Task1: User B is downloading the existing repository to add/edit it. Then he is pushing his changes to the 
	remote, allowing User A to observe any changes.
	
Task2: Both users tried to update (push) the same file. Only 1 of the pushes is accepted. In order for the second user
	to push his updates he must first pull the other user's changes. 

Task3: User B is editing a file without messing with the master branch which other users are also drawing from.

Task4: Both users are working on independent branches in different files. They are avoiding messing with the master
	but also have no interference with each other.

Task5: Like on task 2 there is a conflict because both users are editing the same file. So before the second 
	can successfully push he must first pull the merged changes from user 1
